    <h2>Mathematical definition</h2>

<p>What is math? In the Greek language, the word is &quot;learning, mastering, knowledge&quot;. Aristotle once defined mathematics as &quot;<strong>on the quantity of science</strong>&quot;, this view has been very popular before the 19th century. At that time, the main number of maths / unknowns, the majority of the symbols used are not much different from today. Has been the <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AC%A7%E5%87%A0%E9%87%8C%E5%BE%97%E5%87%A0%E4%BD%95">Euclidean geometry</a> tutorial, Cartesian [analytic geometry], Caldano&#39;s <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E6%AC%A1%E6%96%B9%E7%A8%8B">cubic equation</a> / [quadratic equation] Tong solution, Newton / Leibniz&#39;s <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BE%AE%E7%A7%AF%E5%88%86%E5%AD%A6">calculus</a> is mathematics Development made a series of great achievements. By the nineteenth century, mathematics had completed the perfect abstraction of log / unknowns. In fact, most people&#39;s mathematical knowledge also stays at this stage. For the general public, Aristotle&#39;s definition of mathematics is still not much deviation.</p>

<div style = "margin: 0 auto 15px; width: 60%; text-align: center;">
  <img src = "/img/Euclid.jpg" alt = "Euclid in the Athens Institute" style = "display: block;">

</div>

<p>But from the beginning of the 19th century, mathematics began to study more abstract &quot;<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BE%A4">group</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%B0%84%E5%BD%B1%E5%87%A0%E4%BD%95">projective geometry</a>&quot;, these new mathematical objects can not be directly measured. Mathematicians and philosophers are beginning to try to adapt the new definitions of mathematics to these changes. Their definition is different, such as some emphasis on deductive reasoning, some emphasis on &quot;abstract&quot;, and some focus on some topics that include mathematics. Because of the introduction of more abstract concepts, the debate on mathematical definitions has not been agreed so far: is mathematics itself &quot;invented&quot; or &quot;found&quot;? Mathematics in the end is &quot;art&quot; or &quot;science&quot;? Some people simply said, &quot;Mathematical thing, that is, those things that mathematicians do.&quot;</p>

<h2>Mathematical research content</h2>

<p>So what are the main problems of mathematicians? Can be divided into three main blocks:</p>

<ul>
<li>theoretical mathematics: pure mathematics, according to Wikipedia into the number, structure, space, changes and other aspects of the content</li>
<li>Applied Mathematics: applying mathematics to specific problems such as physics, chemistry, computer, finance, game, etc.</li>
<li>Mathematical basis: axiomatic foundations such as set theory, category theory, and computability theory in computers (P = NP?), Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The study of these problems is to find the &quot;model&quot; of the objective world, to sum up the formula, and to make a reasonable guess. A good mathematical structure is a real-world model, based on mathematical derivation that can predict the real world. Some seemingly completely useless theoretical math / pure mathematics, in the future may be shine in a particular application areas, such as the number of applications in cryptography. The foundation of mathematics is to find the cornerstone of various theories, so that mathematical theory can be a solid development.
The same time as the above-</p>

<h2>Mathematical research methods</h2>

<p>How can i know which mathematical guesses are correct? Mathematics uses two major weapons: <strong>abstract</strong> and <strong>logical reasoning</strong>, axiomatic way to construct a series of propositions.</p>

<p>Axiom in the traditional thought is &quot;self-evident truth&quot;, but this idea is problematic. In form, axiom is just a string of symbols that only make sense for the content of formulas that can be derived from axiomatic systems. The Hilbert plan is intended to put all the mathematics on a solid axiom basis, but according to [the Gödel&#39;s incomplete theorem], every axiom system that is compatible with and can contain the Piano&#39;s axiom must have an unresolvable So the final axiom of all mathematics is impossible. In spite of this, mathematics is often thought of as an axiomatic set theory, in which all mathematical narratives or proofs can be written as a set theory.</p>

<p>In fact, the axiomization of the four operations of nature - <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9A%AE%E4%BA%9A%E8%AF%BA%E5%85%AC%E7%90%86">Picano axiom</a> system was established until the twentieth century. Therefore, the natural number of four operations inside the \(1 + 1 = 2 \), \(3 \times7 = 7 \times3 \) (exchange law) These can be in the Piagio axiom system to prove. Interested can look at Tao Zexang math gods wrote &quot;real analysis&quot;, which is from the Piano natural number of the beginning of the system.</p>

<h2>As a model of the real world</h2>

<p>With regard to mathematics as a model of the real world, the expectations of mathematicians at different stages are quite different:</p>

<p>Galileo (1564-1642):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We need to master the language of the universe and be familiar with the characters it writes, otherwise we can not interpret the universe. It is written in mathematical language, the letters are triangular, round and other geometric shapes. Without these, we can not understand even one of the words. Without these, mankind is wandering in the dark maze.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gauss (1777-1855):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mathematics is the queen of science. \(^ {number theory is the queen of mathematics} \)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hilbert (1862-1943):
  We are not here any nonsense. Mathematics is not like a game of arbitrary rules, but a conceptual system with inherent necessity, so that there is no other way.</p>

<p>Einstein (1879-1955):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because mathematics is a reflection of reality, so they are uncertain; because mathematics is certain, so they are unrealistic.</p>
</blockquote>

  <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Lorenz_attractor_yb.svg" alt = "Lorentz transformation in chaos theory" style = "display: block;">
  Lorentzian transformers in chaos theory
</div>

<p>It can be seen that, to the last Einstein&#39;s argument, mathematics as a real-world model has become increasingly uncertain. Beginning in the 1960s, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">chaos theory</a>, developed by meteorological forecasts, also demonstrates this. In fact, physics is closely related to mathematics - quantum physics, also appeared in a similar situation. Quantum physics itself is deeply influenced by mathematics, and Eugene Wigner has published &quot;[the irrational validity of mathematics in the natural sciences&quot;), pointing out how mathematics can unbelievably lead the discovery of the natural sciences. The most surprising and most mysterious is that in the mathematical layers of the concept of non-material abstraction, contains the deepest and most secret of the material world. Such as π may appear in the demographic model, the existence of imaginary numbers in quantum mechanics.</p>

<h2>The history of mathematics</h2>

<p>Mathematics from the &quot;count&quot; and &quot;measurement of land&quot; two production activities evolved, which formed the algebra and geometry of the two pillars of development. Western mathematics focuses on the development of geometry, the use of Euclid&#39;s axiomatic and logical derivation of the way, not only to promote the development of mathematics, but also profoundly affected the other natural disciplines.</p>

<p>For many abstract mathematical concepts, the geometric sense of understanding is more intuitive, such as the real multiplication of the exchange can be understood as geometric rectangular area unchanged. In some systems, element operations are not necessarily interchangeable, such as groups. Algebra and geometry correspond to two abstract concepts of time and space, which belong to different regions of the brain. Many great mathematicians use geometry to help themselves quickly grasp the core concepts of mathematics, such as 19-year-old proving that Hilbert&#39;s thirteenth question of VI Arnold (1937-2010) <a href="https://book.%20douban.com/subject/3202119/discussion/1364384/">on mathematics education</a>.</p>

<p>In recent years, with the development of computers, geometric graphics more easily displayed. Stanford Math graduate <a href="http://www.3blue1brown.com/about/">3blue1brown</a> just on the use of bilibili graphical intuitive to explain the &quot;<a href="http://space.bilibili.com/88461692/#!/channel/detail?cid=13407">the essence of calculus</a> &quot;and&quot; <a href="http://space.bilibili.com/88461692/#!/channel/detail?cid=94502">linear algebra</a> &quot;and a series of Course, it is a great learning material, kind of meet the feeling of hate. And even highly abstract group theory / near algebra, Youtube also has a professor in a graphical way to explain, a short time to master the group theory of many core concepts: <a href="http:%20//www.math.clemson.edu/%7Emacaule/classes/m17_math4120/index.html">Visual Group Theory</a>.</p>

<p>The history of algebra and geometric alternation of development, to the twenty-first century Klein all geometric unity in the algebra group theory, in the higher level of the formation of a unified abstraction. The history of algebra also covers the development of geometric trends. In the history of algebra, the author summarizes the three stages of algebra:</p>

<ul>
<li>the first abstraction: the value

<ul>
<li>the transition from an instance to a value</li>
</ul></li>
<li>the second abstraction: the word symbol system, that is, with the letter symbol to represent any number (the unknown \( x \))

<ul>
<li>Newton called &quot;pan arithmetic&quot;</li>
<li>the core for solving equations</li>
<li>and the symbols in the geometric concept are slowly differentiated</li>
</ul></li>
<li>third abstraction: new math objects - group, matrix, manifold ...

<ul>
<li>new abstraction level</li>
<li>research logic, abstract algebra (modern algebra), group theory and so on</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>A large number of mathematicians, Mr. Chen also has a <a href="/%20math%20/%201987/04/21%20/%20what-is-geometry.html">&quot;what is geometry&quot;</a> wonderful lectures, summed up the geometric development process, Now read is still deeply inspired.</p>

<p>The two most influential Chinese mathematicians: Hua Luogeng (1910-1985) and Shiing-Shen Chern (1911-2004), both with the Tsinghua University Department of Mathematics, and in the Southwest United Datong dormitory.</p>

<p>Yang Zhenning had this comparison Hua Luogeng and Shiing-Shen Chern:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hua Luogeng and Chern are the important mathematicians of our country, is our wisdom and wisdom of the Chinese nation on behalf of. If there is a teacher, the two called, a question, Hua Luogeng one to do it, Chern to a month to do it, but he opened the issue into a discipline.</p>

<p>Isaiah Berlin (1900-1997) popularizes the Greek concept of two different types of philosophers: &quot;the fox has many skills, and the hedgehog is proficient in a stunt.&quot; I think this is an excellent The way to describe Hua Luogeng is different from that of Chen: He has a wide range of interests and has made an important contribution to several different branches of mathematics; while Chen is focused on a branch of differential geometry, but he innovates this branch, and this innovation later on the 20th century Geometric, algebra, analysis, topology of the major branches have far-reaching impact, and even in-depth impact on the past 40 years the development of theoretical physics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similar to the metaphor of &quot;<a href="http://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2011/8/251096-1.shtm">Birds and Frogs</a>&quot; by Freeman Dyson (1923-), and twenty Century great &quot;bird&quot; mathematician Hilbert, Chern pays more attention to the overall view, the formation of MSRI American Mathematical Institute, to expand the twentieth century differential geometry.</p>
