## Definitions of mathematics

What is math? In the Greek language, the word is "learning, mastering, knowledge". Aristotle defined mathematics as "**the science of quantity**", and  this definition prevailed until the 18th century. At that time, math is about quantity and measurement, and the majority of the symbols used are not much different from today. [Euclidean geometry], Cartesian's [analytic geometry], Caldano's [cubic equation] / [quadratic equation] solutions and Newton/Leibniz's [calculus] are a series of great mathematical achievements. By the nineteenth century, mathematics had completed the perfect abstraction of quantity/unknowns. In fact, most people's mathematical knowledge also stays at this stage. For the general public, Aristotle's definition of mathematics is still not much deviation.

But from the beginning of the 19th century, mathematics began to study more abstract "[group]" and "[projective geometry]", and these new mathematical objects can not be directly measured. Mathematicians and philosophers are beginning to try to adapt the new definitions of mathematics to these changes. Their definition is different, such as some emphasis on deductive reasoning, some emphasis on "abstract", and some focus on some specific mathematical topics. Because of the introduction of more abstract concepts, the debate on mathematical definitions has not been agreed so far: is mathematics itself "invented" or "found"? Mathematics in the end is "art" or "science"? Some people simply said, "Mathematics, that is, those things that mathematicians do."

## Research content in mathematics
So what are the main problems of mathematicians? Can be divided into three main blocks:

- Pure mathematics: theoretical mathematics, according to Wikipedia including number, structure, space, changes and other aspects.
- Applied mathematics: applying mathematics to specific problems such as physics, chemistry, computer, finance, game, etc.
- Foundations and philosophy: axiomatic foundations such as set theory, category theory, and computability theory in computer science(P = NP?), etc.

The study of these problems is to find the "patterns" of the objective world, to sum up the formula, and to make a reasonable guess. A good mathematical structure is a real-world model, based on mathematical derivation that can predict the real world. Some seemingly completely useless theoretical math/pure mathematics, in the future may be shine in a particular application areas, such as the number theory applied in cryptography. The foundations and philosophy is to find the cornerstone of various theories, so that mathematical theory can be solidly developed.

## Mathematical research methods
How can I know which mathematical guesses are correct? Mathematics uses two major weapons: **abstract** and **logical reasoning**, in an axiomatic way to formulate a series of conjectures.

Axioms in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic. At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an axiomatic system. It was the goal of Hilbert's program to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [Gödel's incompleteness theorem] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has undecidable formulas; and so a final axiomatization of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but set theory in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.

In fact, the axiomization of elementary arithmetic - [Picano axiom] system was established until the twentieth century. Therefore, the elementary arithmetic operations such as \\(1 + 1 = 2 \\), \\(3 \times7 = 7 \times3 \\) (exchange law), can be proved in the Piagio axiom system. It has been discussed in Terence Tao's book "real analysis", which is from the introducation of Picano axiom.

## As a model of the real world
With regard to mathematics as a model of the real world, the expectations of mathematicians at different stages are quite different:

Galileo (1564-1642):
  > The universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth.

Gauss (1777-1855):
  > Mathematics is the Queen of the Sciences

Hilbert (1862-1943):
  > We are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise.

Einstein (1879-1955):
  > As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.

</div>

It can be seen that, to the last Einstein's argument, mathematics as a real-world model has become increasingly uncertain. Beginning in the 1960s, the [chaos theory], developed from meteorological forecasts, also demonstrates this. In fact, quantum physics which is closely related to mathematics, also appeared in a similar situation. Quantum physics itself is deeply influenced by mathematics, and Eugene Wigner has published "[The unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]", pointing out how mathematics can unbelievably lead the discovery of the natural sciences. The most surprising and most mysterious is that in the mathematical layers of the concept of non-material abstraction, contains the deepest and most secret of the material world. Such as π may appear in the demographic model, and the existence of imaginary numbers in quantum mechanics etc.

## The history of mathematics

Mathematics is from "count" and "measurement of land" two production activities, which formed the algebra and geometry as the two pillars. Western mathematics focuses on the development of geometry, the use of Euclid's axiomatic and logical derivation, which not only promoted the development of mathematics, but also profoundly affected the other natural disciplines.

For many abstract mathematical concepts, the geometric sense of understanding is more intuitive, such as the commutative real multiplication can be understood as geometric rectangular area unchanged. In some systems, element operations are not necessarily interchangeable, such as in groups. Algebra and geometry correspond to two abstract concepts of time and space, which belong to different regions of the brain. Many great mathematicians use geometry to help themselves quickly grasp the core concepts of mathematics, such as VI Arnold (1937-2010), who proved that Hilbert's thirteenth question at 19, [on mathematics education] (https://book. douban.com/subject/3202119/discussion/1364384/).

In recent years, with the development of computers, geometric graphics can be more easily displayed. Stanford Math graduate [3blue1brown] (http://www.3blue1brown.com/about/) just used graphical intuitive to explain the "[the essence of calculus] (http://space.bilibili.com/88461692/#!/channel/detail?cid=13407)" and "[linear algebra](http://space.bilibili.com/88461692/#!/channel/detail?cid=94502)" and a serie of courses, is a great learning material. And even as highly abstract group theory/modern algebra, a professor just explained in a graphical way on youtube: [Visual Group Theory] (http: //www.math.clemson.edu/~macaule/classes/m17_math4120/index.html).

The history of algebra and geometric alternation of development, to the twenty-first century Klein all geometric unity in the algebra group theory, in the higher level of the formation of a unified abstraction. The history of algebra also covers the development of geometric trends. In the history of algebra, the author summarizes the three stages of algebra:

  - the first abstraction: the value
    - the transition from an instance to a value
  - the second abstraction: the word symbol system, that is, with the letter symbol to represent any number (the unknown \\( x \\))
    - Newton called "pan arithmetic"
    - the core for solving equations
    - and the symbols in the geometric concept are slowly differentiated
  - third abstraction: new math objects - group, matrix, manifold ...
    - new abstraction level
    - research logic, abstract algebra (modern algebra), group theory and so on

Shiing-Shen Chern(陈省身) also had a ["what is geometry"] ({{site.baseurl}}/math/1987/04/21/what-is-geometry.html) wonderful lecture, summed up the geometric development process, which is still inspiring.

The two most influential Chinese mathematicians: Hua Luogeng (华罗庚 1910-1985) and Shiing-Shen Chern(陈省身 1911-2004), both were in the Tsinghua University Department of Mathematics, and in the Southwest United Datong dormitory.

Yang Zhenning(杨振宁) had this comparison Hua Luogeng and Shiing-Shen Chern:
  > Hua Luogeng and Chern are the important mathematicians of our country, is our wisdom and wisdom of the Chinese nation on behalf of. If there is a teacher, the two called, a question, Hua Luogeng one to do it, Chern to a month to do it, but he opened the issue into a discipline.
  >
  > Isaiah Berlin (1900-1997) popularizes the Greek concept of two different types of philosophers: "the fox has many skills, and the hedgehog is proficient in a stunt." I think this is an excellent The way to describe Hua Luogeng is different from that of Chen: He has a wide range of interests and has made an important contribution to several different branches of mathematics; while Chen is focused on a branch of differential geometry, but he innovates this branch, and this innovation later on the 20th century Geometric, algebra, analysis, topology of the major branches have far-reaching impact, and even in-depth impact on the past 40 years the development of theoretical physics.

Similar to the metaphor of "[Birds and Frogs](http://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2011/8/251096-1.shtm)" by Freeman Dyson (1923-), and twenty Century great "bird" mathematician Hilbert, Chern pays more attention to the overall view, the formation of MSRI American Mathematical Institute, to expand the twentieth century differential geometry.

## The key development stage of mathematics
The core concept of modern mathematics "group", but it is only twenty years old that duel death **Galois** developed from. "Unable to solve the equation" for the tragic heroes made a profound description of the characters, but also popular as a "symmetrical" description of the language "group" is how to penetrate into the physical, geometric, biological and other areas, the specific visible [Reading notes]({{site.baseurl}}/book/2017/07/08/book-unsolvable-equation.html).

Twentieth Century [Hilbert's 23 questions], still the climax of mathematicians dreaming of climbing. **Gödel** on the mathematical axiomatic axiomatic proof, in the "Gödel's proof" made a popular explanation, now everywhere in the discussion of artificial intelligence and creativity today, many of which are still profound insights Unique.
